## üåê STEP 3: Deploy Frontend to Netlify

### 3.1 Update API Configuration
Before deploying, update your backend URL in the frontend:

1. Copy your Railway backend URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
2. Update `frontend/netlify.toml`:
```toml
[context.production.environment]
  VITE_API_BASE_URL = "https://your-actual-railway-url.railway.app"
```

### 3.2 Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose GitHub and select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - **Base directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `frontend/dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### 3.3 Configure Environment Variables in Netlify
In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url.railway.app
```

### 3.4 Update CORS Settings
Update your Railway backend environment variables:
```env
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-netlify-site-name.netlify.app,http://localhost:5174
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app,your-railway-app-name.railway.app
```

---

## üîÑ STEP 4: Final Configuration

### 4.1 Update Backend CORS
In Railway, update your environment variables with the actual Netlify URL:
```env
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://amazing-wrytera-123abc.netlify.app
```

### 4.2 Test Your Deployment
1. Visit your Netlify frontend URL
2. Try creating an account
3. Test posting, liking, following features
4. Check that all API calls work properly

---

## üéØ STEP 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

### 5.1 Frontend Custom Domain
In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Domain settings

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure frontend URL is in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
   - Check that URLs don't have trailing slashes

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL`
   - Ensure migrations ran successfully

3. **Static Files Not Loading**
   - Whitenoise is configured in settings
   - Run `python manage.py collectstatic` if needed

4. **Build Failures**
   - Check Railway/Netlify build logs
   - Ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt/package.json

### Useful Commands:
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Redeploy on Railway
railway up

# Check Netlify build logs
# Available in Netlify dashboard under "Deploys"
```
